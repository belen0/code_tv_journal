    %h2 The Story
    %p In addition to consulting wizardry and general internet bad-assery*, Eliza makes custom templates for a boutique CMS. This can be rather tedious, as most themes on the internet are utterly terrible with out-of-date plugins and hideous markup.

    %p Anthony has a hand in many a start-up and doesn't generally work on "enterprise-scale" budgets. This can be rather constraining, as good design is rarely cheap and easy to integrate.

    %p One day, Anthony says to Eliza: "I just turned a generic theme into a Rails site. That sucked. I wish there were themes for Rails."

    %p And Eliza said: "That's brilliant. We're doing it."

    %p It was. And they did.

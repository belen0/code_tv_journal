%h1 Will Paginate

%p You do not need to create this markup yourself.  To acheive these effects, just use will_paginate as you normally would.

.row
  .large-6.small-12.columns
    %h2 Page 1 of 4:
    %p
      %em (Markup was generated by will_paginate)
    .pagination
      %span.previous_page.disabled ← Previous
      %em.current 1
      = link_to 2, "#", rel: "next"
      = link_to 3, "#"
      = link_to 4, "#"
      = link_to "Next →", "#", rel: "next", class: "next_page"

  .large-6.small-12.columns.mobile-margin-top

      %em (Markup was generated by will_paginate)
    .pagination
      = link_to "← Previous", "#", rel: "prev start", class: "previous_page"
      = link_to 1, "#", rel: "prev start"
      %em.current 2
      = link_to 3, "#", rel: "next"
      = link_to 4, "#"
      = link_to "Next →", "#", rel: "next", class: "next_page"
